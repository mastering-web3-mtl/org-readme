> **Mastering Web3 Development Montreal**
Welcome to the Montreal-based Web3 development community org!
>

### "Ok, yet another meetup. Why?"

The goal behind this meetup is to build a community in Montreal with *all* who have an interest in learning and practicing development specifically relating with *Web3* applications.

This meetup aims to be *tech-agnostic*. Topics will be proposed and voted by the community.

Web3 is helping us transition to a world where individuals are increasingly understanding and receiving the true value of their contributions. That said, we'll be practicing the engineering skills required to contribute to this shift and build applications that will provide mechanisms for the distribution of value.

### "I have no experience in Web3 development. Can I still join?"

Anyone of any skill level may join. So many things are happening in the space that we will require each other's help regardless of previous experience.
We are all beginners in some way, and it is best to keep a beginner's mind if our intention is to truly understand. Be patient, ask questions and, be willing to make mistakes.
